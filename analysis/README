=== plot.py ===
plot.py takes in a trace file via stdin, finds all unique pages that are
accessed, and then renders a plot showing which pages are being touched
in each time interval. Currently, it just takes N memory accesses and groups
them into one time-step, but it will eventually support grouping by events.

Each column represents one timestep and each row represents one 4KB page. Since
most memory accesses are very sparsely populated, intervening pages that are
never accessed are omitted - this is not a to-scale representation of the
entire virtual memory space.

Pages are sorted by address in descending order, so that pages at the top
roughly correspond to the stack, and pages at the bottom roughly correspond
to the code/text/heap. 

At each timestep, if a page is accessed in multiple ways, its color is
determined by the relative ratio of the memory accesses. red indicates a data
read, green indicates a data write, and blue indicates an instruction read.
If both read and write operations occur on the same page during a single
timestep, the color is proportional to the number of operations of each type.
